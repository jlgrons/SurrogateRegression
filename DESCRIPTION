Description: Performs estimation and inference on a partially missing target outcome while borrowing information from a correlated surrogate outcome to increase estimation precision and improve power. The target and surrogate outcomes are jointly modeled within a bivariate outcome regression framework. Unobserved values of either outcome are regarded as missing data. Estimation in the presence of bilateral outcome missingness is performed via an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. A flexible association test is provided for evaluating hypotheses about the target regression parameters.
