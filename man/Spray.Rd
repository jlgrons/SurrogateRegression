\title{Spray: Surrogate Phenotype Regression Analysis}
\description{
This package performs estimation and inference for the parameters of a
bivariate normal regression model in which elements of the response matrix
are missing at random. Estimation is performed using \code{\link{fit.bnr}}.
Inference on regression parameters for the target outcome is performed using
\code{\link{test.bnr}}.
